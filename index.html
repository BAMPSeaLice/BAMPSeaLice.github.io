						The <STRONG>Broughton Archipelago Monitoring Plan </STRONG>(BAMP) began in 2010 as a multiyear sea lice monitoring and research programme 
						involving federal government, salmon farm producers, conservationists and academic researchers.
					</P>
					
					<P>
						The Broughton Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern tip of Vancouver Island in the northeastern flank of the 
						Queen Charlotte Strait on the coast of British Columbia, Canada (see map at right).
					</P> 
			
					<P>
						Approximately 15 active salmon farms are located in this complex geographic region, as well as a number of
						important juvenile salmon migration routes.
					</P>	
						
					<P>
						Unfortunately due to some 'hosting issues' the web site became inactive in early 2018 - we hope that this will be rectified
