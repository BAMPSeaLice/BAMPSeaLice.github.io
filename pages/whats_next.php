<H2>what's next?</H2>
<P>A number of BAMP research objectives were set for 2011 and are described in detail below. 
These research activities will be undertaken by individual members of the BAMP Science Team, outside contractors and research students.</P>
<P>
	<UL>
		<LI><B>BAMP Database / Virtual Research Environment (VRE) Development</B> - as part of the Data Sharing Agreements under the BAMP initiative, a comprehensive database is currently being created which will incorporate recent and historic wild and farm salmon
			 data and will provide analytical support for a range of different analyses and modeling exercises. This database should become accessible to all researchers in BAMP
			 November 2011 and will allow the 2010 and 2011 lice count data to be placed in the context of longer term historic trends. </LI>
		<LI><B>Modeling sea lice population dynamics on salmon farms in Broughton Archipelago</B> - this research is currently underway. Models to be used in this analysis 
			build upon established methods to analyze patterns of sea lice population growth and efficacy of SLICE treatment. 
			The overall objective is an improved understanding of sea lice population dynamics on farms in order to inform management strategies that minimize sea 
			lice risks to wild salmon.  
			The results of this research are expected to be presented in the form of a scientific paper for publication in a peer reviewed journal in Spring 2012.</LI>
		<LI><B>Hydrodynamic modeling</B> – modeling of circulation, temperature, and salinity fields is currently being undertaken and the results will be used in a second model that
			 hindcasts the dispersion and growth/mortality of lice originating on farms. </LI>
		<LI><B>Database manipulation and descriptive epidemiological summaries of sea lice infestation on farmed and wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago</B> – this research 
			 commenced in late 2011 and will involve conducting an assessment of the structure of the BAMP database/VRE and the scope of the interface i.e. database manipulation. 
			 The research will also provide some key high-level data sub-sets/queries (“descriptive epidemiological summaries”) and will utilize spatial interpolation 
			 techniques to answer some specific BAMP Terms of Reference research objectives around variations in spatial and temporal patterns in different data sets. 
			 The results of this research are expected to be presented in the form of a scientific paper for publication in a peer reviewed journal in Spring 2012.</LI>
		<LI><B>Historical analysis of sea lice counts on wild fish</B> – it is anticipated that this research will commence late in 2011. Up to 8 years of sea lice count
			 data from wild salmon, which exists from two different sources, will be analyzed to compare and contrast lice profiles seen in the historical data and to
			 provide a better understanding of the migration patterns of the various wild salmonid species in the Broughton Archipelago.</LI>
